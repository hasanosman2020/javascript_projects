This is the course provided by John Smilga on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/
)) entitled [JavaScript Tutorial and Projects Course (2022)](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-tutorial-for-beginners-w/
) 
The course consists of 30 javascript projects. It is an excellent course and I am learning a tremendous amount, evidenced by the projects completed and listed below. 



# javascript_projects
1. Colour-Flipper. A button is displayed which, when clicked by the user, will change the background colour of the body and will display the code of the colour being displayed. There are two buttons. The first 'Colour Flipper' button will have a set amount of colours and will display the hexadecimal code of the colour. The 'Simple Hex' button will generate a random colour from the hexadecimal code of colours and display that code. 

2. Counter. We build a counter so I can increase the count, decrease the count and send the count back to zero. The positive numbers will be in green, the negative numbers were in red and the number zero will be in black. 

3. Reviews. This project will have reviews and we use JavaScript to loop over the reviews.

4. Navbar html. A navbar toggle project where the links in the navbar on a wider screen extend across the top of the page and on smaller screens we toggle the links.

5. Sidebar. The project creates a sidebar and we use JavaScript to toggle the sidebar as well s close the sidebar.

6. Modal. The project has a background image and a banner in the middle ith some content and a button. Clicking the button will bring up a modal with an overlay and some content. The modal is removed by clicking on it. 

7. Questions. The project is an FAQ section where we have a list of questions and the user reveals the answer by clicking on the + icon.

8. Menu. A restaurant menu where the menu items are displayed dynamically. Once the page loads we use JavaScript to populate our page and also set up some filtering options. 

9. Tabs. The 'About' section where we have an image and some information contained under different tabs. Each tab contains different content and such content is revealed when the user clicks on the corresonding tab.
